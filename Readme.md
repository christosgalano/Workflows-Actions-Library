# Workflow-Actions-Library

## General

Repository with several custom actions and workflow templates to be used by other actions and workflows. For more see [Custom Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions) and [Reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows).

All the workflows here work best when they are called from a repository following the [Azure-Template-Repo's](https://github.com/christosgalano/Azure-Template-Repo) structure.
